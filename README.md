# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview

The **Credit Card Fraud Detection** is simple beginner project aims to identify fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning algorithms and data analytics techniques. By analyzing historical transaction data, we detect patterns indicative of fraudulent behavior, allowing for timely intervention and prevention.

## Key Features

- **Data Exploration**: Explore the dataset to understand its structure, features, and distribution.
- **Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values and outliers.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create relevant features that enhance model performance.
- **Model Building**: Train and evaluate machine learning models for fraud detection.

## Algorithm Used

Logistic Regression: Logistic Regression is a widely used supervised machine learning algorithm for binary classification tasks.It is a commonly used algorithm for credit card fraud detection.

## Dataset

We utilize an anonymized dataset containing credit card transactions. Each record includes transaction details such as transaction amount, timestamp, and other relevant features.

## Results

The trained models achieve an accuracy of approximate 94% in detecting fraudulent transactions. Further optimization and fine-tuning can enhance performance.

## Future Work

- Explore deep learning models (e.g., neural networks) for improved accuracy.
- Investigate feature importance and interpretability.
- Implement real-time monitoring and alerting for suspicious transactions.
